As a software engineer, I enjoy developing innovative solutions for various products and platforms, using my skills in teamwork, communication, and problem solving. I have over a year of work experience, including a role as a software development engineer at Microsoft, where I contributed to the design, development, and testing of features and enhancements for the Microsoft Purview's Data Lifecycle Management feature.

I am currently pursuing a Master of Science degree in Computer Science from Georgia Institute of Technology, where I am learning advanced topics and techniques in AI/ML and computing systems. I have a Bachelor of Technology degree in Computer Science from IIT Delhi, where I also gained research experience as an intern at LG Soft India, working on machine learning projects related to natural language processing. Additionally, I was involved in the student chapter of ACES-ACM, where I organized events and campaigns to promote computer science education and awareness. I am passionate about learning new technologies, collaborating with diverse teams, and creating impactful software that enhances user experience and delivers value.
