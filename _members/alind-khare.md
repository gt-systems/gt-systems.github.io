Alind Khare is a PhD student in the Habanero Laboratory of School of Computer Science, Gatech, working under Prof. Vivek Sarkar and Prof. Alexey Tumanov. His research aims to make AI (DL) more accessible/easy-to-use to the community so that the application developers using DL models don’t have to care about SLO’s such as accuracy, latency requirements etc. His work experience at IBM Research Labs has also motivated him to work in making DL models fit for deployment on edge devices.
