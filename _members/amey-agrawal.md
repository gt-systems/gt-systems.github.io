I am a PhD student at Georgia Tech where I am advised by Prof. Alexey Tumanov. I have been working as a research intern at Microsoft Research with Dr. Ramachandran Ramjee’s team since summer’23. My primary area of interest is systems for machine learning.

Previously, I was a research engineer at Microsoft Research, where I worked in Dr. Muthian Sivathanu’s team on low-level systems for deep learning infrastructure. Before that, I spent a couple of years working at Qubole, a big data platform start-up. I did my bachelor’s in Computer Science from BITS Pilani, India in 2018.
