I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the School of Computer Science at Georgia Tech since August 2019. I completed my postdoc at the University of California, Berkeley, working with Ion Stoica and collaborating closely with Joseph Gonzalez. I completed my Ph.D. at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Gregory Ganger. At Carnegie Mellon, I was honored by the prestigious NSERC Alexander Graham Bell Canada Graduate Scholarship (NSERC CGS-D3) and partially funded by the Intel Science and Technology Centre for Cloud Computing and the Parallel Data Lab industry consortium. I came to Carnegie Mellon from the University of Toronto, where I worked with Eyal de Lara on agile stateful VM replication with para-virtualization. My interest in cloud computing, datacenter operating systems, and programming the cloud brought me to the University of Toronto from industry, where I had been developing cluster middleware for distributed datacenter resource management. I build novel distributed systems and contribute to open source. My earliest open source contributions were to Intel Cluster Ready Open Cluster Stack, where I was one of the key contributors.
