I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor in the School of Computer Science at Georgia Institute of Technology. My research interests are broadly in the systems and networking space, with a current focus on systems that span the cloud, the network, and the edge in enabling efficient data analysis and machine learning.

Before coming to Georgia Tech, I was a researcher at Microsoft Research. I completed my PhD in Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley advised by Ion Stoica. Previously, I worked with the Mobility, Networks & Systems group at Microsoft Research India. I completed my Masters degree in Computer Science from the University of Texas at Austin advised by Lili Qiu. My undergraduate degree is from College of Engineering, Trivandrum.
