I am a forever tech geek and currently pursuing Masters in Computer Science at Georgia Institute of Technology. I completed my BTech in Electrical Engineering (with Honours) with Minors in Computer Science from Indian Institute of Technology Bombay in 2023. My primary interests include areas of systems, cloud computing, and machine learning.

Dancing and casually playing badminton or table tennis are my all-time stress busters. I absolutely love reading, be it thrillers, sci-fi, humour, or autobiographies.
