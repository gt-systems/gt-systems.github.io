      <p data-search="IntroductionIf you ve trained deep learning models  you know the process can take hours or days  weeks   and thousands of dollars  worth of computation  With increasing use of DNNs in common production  this problem only gets bigger   they need to be used on diverse deployment targets with widely varying latency constraints  based on hardware capabilities and application requirements  Designing DNN architectures that maximize accuracy under these constraints adds another degree of complexity requiring manual expertise and or neural architecture search  NAS    which are even slower and costlier than training  Clearly  repeating these processes for every deployment target is not scalable and therefore  solving this problem is essential for making DNNs easier to use in real deployment           In CompOFA  we propose a cost effective and faster technique to build model families that support multiple deployment platforms  Using insights from model design and system deployment  we build upon the current best methods that take 40 50 GPU days of computation and make their training and searching processes faster by 2x and 200x  respectively   all while building a family of equally efficient and diverse models How it s done today                    Conventional  individual training      The prevailing norm today is to build individual neural networks  We design and train single monolithic DNNs with a fixed accuracy and latency measure  or computational complexity  energy usage  etc    Both  designing efficient architectures and training on production grade datasets  require computation worth several GPU hours with slow turnaround  expensive hardwares and expertise in ML and Systems  In 2019  a study estimated the carbon emissions of one well known NAS technique to be 283 metric tons   or nearly 60 times the emissions over an average human lifetime  Thus it is simply unscalable to continue this trend of designing and training individual DNNs for deployment                     Once For All  OFA   co trained model families      Once For All  OFA  proposed to address this problem via weight shared sub networks of a larger network  These sub networks of varying sizes had diverse accuracy and latency measures and could be trained simultaneously  rather than one by one   Post this one time training  one can independently search and extract a subnetwork with optimal accuracy for a given deployment  Hence  OFA significantly improved the scalability over the naïve method  But  at 40 50 GPU days of train time  OFA remained expensive and required special training  amp  searching procedures for its huge search space of  10  19   models In CompOFA  we find insights that speed up OFA s training and searching methodologies  while making it easier to use CompOFAOFA built a model search space by slicing smaller subnetworks from a larger network   by choosing subsets of its layers  depth   channels  width   resolution  etc  This choice was made independently at each layer  contributing to a combinatorial explosion of  10  10  10  19   models  These models don t come free   training so many of them together needs a slow  phased approach  After training  the search also requires building special accuracy and latency estimators But do we need such a large search space       Are all these models efficient  No  Many of these subnetworks are of dimensions that are suboptimal  lying well below the optimal accuracy latency tradeoff         Are all these models different enough  No  Imagine  10  19   networks where the smallest and largest differ in latency by just 100ms   this fine granularity is too small to matter for real hardware   In CompOFA  we question whether we can identify and focus our attention just on models that are close to optimal  and at a sufficient granularity   After all  it s not common practice to treat these model dimensions as independent or random    we often combine dimensions like depth and width to vary together i e  in a compound fashion  This common intuition is backed by empirical studies like EfficientNet and RegNet  which showed that there are optimal relations between these dimensions                     CompOFA reduces combinatorial explosion of the search space by exploiting the same direction of growth of accuracy and latency       Inspired by this  CompOFA uses a simple but powerful heuristic   choose models that grow depth and width together  This makes our search space much more tractable  but still just as efficient and diverse for actual use In our paper  we show that we can train this model family in half the time and all at once  without a slow phased approach  After training  we can search for models 216x faster  and without the time and effort to build special estimators           Despite these savings  CompOFA does not compromise on its original goal  It s able to extract networks for multiple latency targets on distinct hardware types  and match the existing SOTA in both optimality and range of its models                     CompOFA generates efficient model families for diverse hardwares   from mobile phones to GPUs      Learn moreCompOFA improves the speed  cost  and usability of jointly training models for many deployment targets  By highlighting insights on model design and system deployment  we try to address an important problem for real world usability of DNNs To know more  please check out our paper and poster at ICLR 2021  Our code and pretrained models are also available
